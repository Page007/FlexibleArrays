# FlexibleArrays
Arrays combined with a capacity of inbuilt sorting and also computing the approx. run time of the inbuilt functions.
One of the basic objectives of this is to abstract even the smallest details of list ops from the users in C++ language, wihout
using standard template classes, although, it is easier to use them. 
Additional ops to be added : 
1. Implementation of stacks as well as queues in the class, in O(1).
2. It is a reusabl library, which can be directly used with the codes.
